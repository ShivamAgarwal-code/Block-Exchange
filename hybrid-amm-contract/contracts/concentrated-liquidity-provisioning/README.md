Concentrated Liquidity Provision (CLP) is a method used in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to enable liquidity providers to concentrate their liquidity around specific price ranges. Traditional automated market makers (AMMs), such as Uniswap, allocate liquidity uniformly across the entire price range of a trading pair. However, this approach can lead to inefficient use of capital and potentially higher slippage for trades.

With CLP, liquidity providers have the ability to provide liquidity within a narrower price range. This allows for greater capital efficiency and can lead to reduced slippage for trades that fall within the concentrated range. By concentrating liquidity in specific areas, CLP aims to improve the trading experience for users and provide more attractive trading conditions.

CLP can be implemented in various ways depending on the specific DEX platform or protocol. It typically involves mechanisms to incentivize liquidity providers to concentrate their liquidity in specific price ranges, such as offering additional rewards or incentives. Some implementations also incorporate dynamic adjustments of liquidity ranges based on market conditions to optimize liquidity provision.

Overall, CLP is a method used to enhance liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges, improving capital efficiency and reducing slippage for trades within the concentrated liquidity range.
